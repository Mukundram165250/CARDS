Assets folder guide
--------------------

This project expects your card photos and logo to live in an `assets` folder
next to `index.html`, for example:

- assets/cards/  → add your card images here
- assets/logo/   → add your logo and favicon here

You can create these folders in File Explorer and then update the `index.html`
card gallery to use your real images instead of the coloured placeholders.
